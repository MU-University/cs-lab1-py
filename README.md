# Task: Implementing an Add Method

## Description

This repository contains a simple Python app that requires the implementation of an `add` method. The `add` method is responsible for adding two numbers together.

## Task

Implement the `add` method in the `app.py` file. The method should accept two parameters, `x` and `y`, and return their sum.

## Code Example

```python
def add(x, y):
    return pass
```

## Usage

1. Implement the `add` method in the `app.py` file.
2. Run the Python script to test the implementation.
