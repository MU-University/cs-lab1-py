## Task: Implementing an Add Method

### Description

This repository contains a simple Python app that requires the implementation of an `add` method. The `add` method is responsible for adding two numbers together.

### Task

### Code Example

```python
def add(x, y):
    return pass
```

### Usage

1. Implement the `add` method in the `app.py` file.
2. Run the Python script to test the implementation.
